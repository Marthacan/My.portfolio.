      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style = "font-size:1.2rem;">I am Martha Okadah, a passionate and curious Computer Science student at JKUAT. I enjoy solving real-world problems using code, and I am particularly drawn to system analysis, software development, and the intersection between tech and people.

I have a growing skill set in Java, HTML/CSS, and Python, and I love combining logic with creativity,whether I am programming or creating beadwork and crochet bags. I'm also deeply interested in public speaking and diplomacy, which reflects my love for clear communication and leadership.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Terminal-Based Calculator (Python)</h3>
    <p style = "font-size:1.2rem;">
      I designed and developed this calculator entirely from scratch using Python. Itâ€™s a simple yet functional terminal-based program that allows users to input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of user input handling, conditional logic, and basic programming structure.
    </p>
    <p style = "font-size:1.2rem;">
      This project is a complete piece, from writing the code to testing it and ensuring it runs smoothly. It's a reflection of my growing foundation in Python and my ability to build useful tools independently.
